# Exercise Tracker

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/url-shortener-microservice).

## Functionality

This is the [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker) project, where I make an API that creates users, assigns exercises to those users, and allows those exercises to be queried.

## Thoughts

Tbd...

God bless.
